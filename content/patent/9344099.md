abstract = "Embodiments are described for a method of continuously measuring the ratio of frequencies between the transmit and receive clock domains of a heterochronous system using an array of digital frequency measurement circuits that provide overlapping frequency and detection interval measurements within single counter periods required for a single frequency measurement circuit to complete a frequency measurement. Embodiments may be used in a predictive synchronizer to provide low latency, continuous frequency measurements for system-on-chip (SOC) devices that employ frequency drift or ramping to reduce power consumption and overheating conditions."
