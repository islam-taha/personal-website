abstract = "An input signal and a reset signal are provided to respective inputs of a resettable flip-flop. The resettable flip-flop generates an output signal. The output signal transitions from a first logic state to a second logic state in response to corresponding transitions of the input signal and transitions from the second logic state to the first logic state in response to assertion of the reset signal. A warning signal is asserted in response to transitions of the input signal from the second logic state to the first logic state. A logic gate forwards the output signal when the warning signal is de-asserted and provides a signal in the first logic state in response to assertion of the warning signal."
