abstract = "A circuit includes a plurality of synchronizers to adapt a signal from a first clock domain to a second clock domain. Each synchronizer of the plurality of synchronizers includes a synchronizer input to receive the signal from the first clock domain and a synchronizer output to provide the signal as adapted to the second clock domain. The circuit also includes a multiplexer (mux) that includes a plurality of mux inputs and a mux output. Each mux input is coupled to the synchronizer output of a respective synchronizer of the plurality of synchronizers. The mux output provides the signal, as adapted to the second clock domain, from the synchronizer output of a selected synchronizer of the plurality of synchronizers."
