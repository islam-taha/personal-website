Most of us academic/industrial ECE/CS researchers want to make our 
results as reproducible as possible. Its good for the integrity of our
field and it also helps future researchers and developers who 
want to build on our prior work. [GitHub](https://github.com/) is great 
for distributing
software, but code can rarely be
compiled and run on its own as nearly all modern software relies
heavily on packages and dependencies. Thankfully,
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is here to save
the day!
