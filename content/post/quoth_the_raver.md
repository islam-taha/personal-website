Back in 2010 I started a blog dedicated to electronic music called Quoth
the Raver (a play on Quoth the Raven). It was a huge amount of fun
sharing the music I found with everyone on the site, and it inspired me
to get even more familiar with the various genres, artists, and labels.
These days electronic music (also known as EDM) has exploded in
popularity, so the novelty of sharing new artists has worn off to a
certain extent. For this reason I haven't updated the blog in quite a
long time, but I did recently go through to fix up some broken components
for archiving the site.

If anyone is curious to see what I was listening to and raving about
back then feel free to [check out the
website!](https://quoththeraverarchive.wordpress.com/) If you're more
interested in what I'm listening to these days, go ahead and check out
what I love on [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/quoththeraver).
